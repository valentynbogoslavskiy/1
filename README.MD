### **MaterialUI**

Material UI is the library for creating user interfaces. Use it to create application's ui elements. Configurations of Material ui theme is stored in `styles-config/theme.ts` file. If you need to change styles of default component you can use this file or `makeStyles` function based approach(to see how it looks just open one of the file from `uikit` directory). If you need to set the new style's value for all application, please, use `styles-config/custom-options.ts` for this.

### getInitialProps and getServerSideProps nextjs methods

There are two different approaches for page content rendering - with two nextjs functions. 
`GetInitialProps` method is using for two pages: Home(`/`) and Register|SignIn(`/login`) pages. These pages use mobx store to save and render its content.
`GetServerSideProps` method is using for AboutUs(`/aboutus`) and JoinUs(`/joinUs`) pages. These pages do not use the mobx store and they both ask server for content every time user visit these page.
You can compare these two approaches and choose what is the best on your point of view. 
On my opinion, before to choose appropriate approach the backend should receive real data. 
But you can use `getServerSideProps` method it shuould not affect on page loading scores a lot.


### UI components examples

There are some examples of using the UI components on the home page. Before create the new ui component, please, check if this component already exist on the Home page. It saves your time.
